## Project Overview

This repo contains my submission to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! In this project, I learnt how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  :p

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, important design decisions about the user experience are made.  

Goal is that by completing this lab to understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  

The imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!


## (Optionally) Accelerating the Training Process 

If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen CNN architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU.  If you'd like to use a GPU, you can spin up an instance of your own:

## Evaluation

This project was reviewed and accepted by a Udacity reviewer against the CNN project rubric.


## Project Submission

The submission contains:
- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- An HTML export of the project notebook with the name `report.html`.
